    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    /// these are primitive and are not passed by reference

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    const play2 = players; // this makes a reference of the players

    console.log(players, play2);

    play2[0] = 'WOHOOO changed';

    console.log(players, play2);


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const play3 = player.slice(); // this creates a copy of the array
    
    const play4 = [].concat(players); // this also creates a copy

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const play5 = [...players]; // this creates a copy very elegantly
    
    const play6 = Array.from(players);  // this also creates a copy but less elegantly

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const per2 = person;  // passed by reference

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const per3 = Object.from({}, person, {allThe: 'Extras'}); //  ( empty, to_be_copied_array, extra_elements_we_might_wanna_add )

    const per4 = {...person}; // we're back to elegance

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
